# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing Kickstarter data to find trends that can be used to create more successful projects.
# Overview of Project
This analysis was created to help find trends in successful kickstarter campaigns in order to help Louise's next fundraiser reach it's goal. After analysis was complete of over one thousand campaigns we were able to distinguish trends using both launch date and goals. You will find this conclusions in the results section.
# Analysis and Challenges 
### How Analysis Was Preformed
One of the biggest pieces of this analysis was determining when the best time to launch a campaign is. After narrowing down the data to only show the kickstarters that were for theater projects. A pivot table was created that displays the number of campaigns that were successful, failed, and canceled each month. The line graph that was created is also able to be filter based on year which allows a more in-depth look.![Theater Outcomes vs Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105613428/173255472-82fd3e9f-76b7-4457-b119-26667f03e8d8.png)
 The second piece that was analized was the outcomes based on the goal that was set. Using excels countifs function we were able to create another line graph using the percentages of success and failures for each range. There was alot of data to use with a wide range of goals set so instead of having a point for each indiviual goal amount a range was created. Each range was about five thousand dollars wide.![Outcome Based on Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105613428/173255466-774a7a8d-4c5c-4fcb-8330-c8733610b07d.png)
 ### Challenges
There weren't any challenges or difficulties when it came to using this data as it was very detailed and there was alot to use. Having a large amount of data can present an issue with making sure that it is valid and correct. It is too time consuming to go through and check each indiviual point to make sure nothing is being fabricated.
# Results
### Outcome by Launch Date
One conclusion that can be drawn from outcomes based on lauch date is that campaigns that are launched at the end of spring/beginning of summer tend to have the most success. May has the largest number of successful campaigns. Failed campaigns are also highest at this time but this is most likely due to there being more campaigns launched during this time. You can see that as the middle months of the year continue the number of successful outcomes trends downward but the failed outcomes sits at aound the same number. Another convlusion that can be drawn is that there is a big spike of failed projects in October
### Outcome Based on Goals
A conclusion that can be seen on the graph is that the higher amount that each goal is set for the lower chances it has of succeeding. The line trends downward until about the 25,000 mark. There is a small jump up after but this is due to the number of campaigns that actually had this high of a goal to begin with. The lower number makes the data in this range unreliable.
### Limiations 
One limitation of this data set is that it the newest data in it is from five years ago and goes back almost twelve years ago. It is best to include the newest data availble when looking at trends. Things change quickly and having data from a decade ago may not be as useful as data from a year or two ago. This is something that should be kept in mind when making decisions based on this analysis.
### Other Possible Tables
Another good table to make would be to create a graph that shows the relationship between success and the duration of the kickstarter. This could show the point where a campaign should be considered a failure and ended while also setting a realistic expectation of how long it could take to fund the project.
